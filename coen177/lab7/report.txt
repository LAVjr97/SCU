Steps: Once in the Minix machine, "cd .." until you are in the root directory, then type  then type "cd usr/src/kernel".
       To establish an ftp connection 

Observations: Having changed the scheduler, the bootup process took much longer, and doing a normal system call 
              such as "ls" would take significantly longer than before.
