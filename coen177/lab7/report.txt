// Title: Lab 7 Minix Scheduling

Steps: Following the steps written in my lab 6 report, once in the minix machine and an ftp connection is established 
       between the host and minix machine, type "cd usr/src/kernel" then "get proc.c" on the host machine. Then once in
       proc.c, the function called "pick_pro" is where the os decides which process to run. in order to add an element of 
       randomness, using a random number generator, a number from 0 to 29 is generated, everytime a process is going to 
       be picked. In the same if statement where it checks if the head is empty in the queue, an "or" is added to check 
       if the random number is larger than 15 and that "q" which stands for the level of priority a process has, is 
       greater than 0.

Observations: Having changed the scheduler, the bootup process took much longer, and doing a normal system call 
              such as "ls" took significantly longer than before.
