Step 6: The program outputs the line from the function go multiple times with
        the same numbered iteration, with all of them having 0 as it's iteration. The 
        reason this happens is because when pthread_create is called, it passes i's
        address, and since threads used shared memory, when the first thread reaches the
        next for loop, i is set to 0 again, so the most recent value of i is printed out 
        in the go funtion which is 0.
