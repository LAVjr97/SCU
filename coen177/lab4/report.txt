Step 1: When threadshello.c runs, each thread runs the go function once, and joins the main thread once it returns from
        the go function. And the order of which thread is being executed and returns changes everytime that the program
        is re-run. When running the program however while watching a video, listening to music and playing a game at the 
        same time, I would see that about half of the time, it would say "Hello from thread 0" for all of the threads. The 
        argument recieved in the go function are per-thread since each thread will have it's own pointer that points to the
        i in the main function. The 'i' in the main function is also a per thread variable which are then stored in each 
        thread's stack.

Step 2: When the second for loop is deleted, the "Hello from thread" lines are still printing however when returning to 
        the main function, "Main thread done" prints once.
