// Observations: I just found it interesting that for both step 3 and 4 that after the intial round of producers adding
                 adding to the buffers, that the threads would begin to produce/consumer at different intervals, where normally
                 the producer would add 5 or 10 items and the consumer would remove 5 or 10 items respectively. It would then
                 change to the producer only adding 2 items at a time before the consumer would remove 2 items at a time as 
                 well.
