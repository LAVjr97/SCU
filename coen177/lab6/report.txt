Steps:

First, look up "NoMachine scu" on google to find the proper link to install NoMachine on your computer. Once installed
and configured, open up a terminal and type "set vmware", this command prepares vmware and only has to be done once everytime
you first open it. Then type "minix-get-image", this only needs to be done once, since this ereases any previous instance of 
minix and creates a fresh new one. So it should only be done again if the minix machine breaks. Then type "vmware &" to 
launch it. Once launched, you should see the minix machine as an option. Once you launch the minix machine, you'll be asked 
a username, which will be "root". In order to set a password, type "passwd" and enter your new password twice. Then to set up 
ftp, so you can transfer fles between the minix machine and your local linux machine, type "tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &" on the
minix machine. Then type "ifconfig" to see your ip address. It should be the first set of numbers. Then "ctrl + alt" to 
return to your local linux machine, and open a new terminal and type "ftp <minix ip address>". Which after a while will
ask for your minix machine's username and password. Once in, type "ls" to view the remote directory, and "cd" to change
the remote directory, "lcd" to view the local directory, and "lcd <path to directory>" to change local directory. Use the commands
"get <file name>" and "put <file name>" to get a file from the remote machine, and put to put a file in the remote machine. 
So in order to change the copyright statement from the boot up message, type "cd usr/src/kernel", then "get main.c" and 
then you should be able to edit the "announce()" function. Once edited and saved with the new message, type "put main.c".
Now going back to your minix machine, if you weren't already in "/usr/src" go to that directory. Once there, type "make world"
Once it has recompiled, type "reboot" and then you should see that the bootup message will have changed.
