/*
Write a program that includes an array of 120 unsigned integers. Fill that array with one cycle of
a sine wave scaled for use with an A/D converter such that the A/D converter input value ranges
from 0-4095.
Next, print out that array as a C data structure to a file called sindat.h â€“ an initialized array of
integers, such that it can be included in another C program. The output is source code that could
be included directly into another C program. Test the output to make sure it is proper C code.
