/*
I wish to analyze the scholarly writings listed on the following pages in order to study the role of
repetition in contemporary balladry. In order to assist me in this task you are to write a C
program that parses the text on the next page and performs the following functions. Read the
description very carefully.

Each time a word is repeated (i.e., the same word appears two or more times in a row within
the same line of the song or on consecutive lines, with or without punctuation between) you
will output the word, followed by the number of local repetitions. i.e. I-I-I is 3 repetitions.
You should treat all capitalized copies of the word as the same as uncapitalized copies.

Assume that hyphens, parentheses, commas, and periods are punctuation that separates words.
Apostrophes are part of words.
You must figure out how to represent the text on the next 2 pages as a single constant string in
your program.
