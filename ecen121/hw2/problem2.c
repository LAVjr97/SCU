/*
Write a program that uses a #include statement to include the sindat.h file from your problem 2.
This new program should allow you to:
1) Input an integer between 0 and 359 representing phase in degrees. This is I.
2) Use the lookup table in sindat.h to approximate the sine of the input value I. This is V1.
3) Use the sine function in C to calculate the sine of the input value I. This is V2
4) Print out V1, V2, and the percentage error in V1 as compared to V2.
Example: If I is 45, the output values should be something like:

0.705 0.707 -0.28%
*/

#include <sindat.h>

int main(void){

    return 0;
